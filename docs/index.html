        <h1>Are you ready?</h1>
<p>This is a self assessment, but it is also a Coders Campus assessment.</p>
<p>Please follow these instructions very carefully if you are preparing to onboard into a Coders Campus bootcamp.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we use your own assessment to establish a baseline for how well you follow instructions. There is only one acceptable score for a Coders Campus self assessment, and that score is &quot;Ready&quot;.</p>
<h2>This May Be Difficult</h2>
<p>There are tasks within this self assessment that some people may find difficult. This is both expected, and necessary.</p>
<p>The difficulty level of these tasks is very ordinary for a bootcamp student at most any bootcamp. So if any of these tasks is difficult for you - you should know that, going in.</p>
