# Are you ready?

This is a self assessment, but it is also a Coders Campus pre-bootcamp assessment.

Please follow these instructions very carefully if you are preparing to onboard into a Coders Campus bootcamp.

Why?

Because we use your own assessment to establish a baseline for how well you follow instructions. There is only one acceptable score for a Coders Campus self assessment, and that score is "Ready".

## This May Be Difficult

There are tasks within this self assessment that some people may find difficult. This is both expected, and necessary.

The difficulty level of these tasks is very ordinary for a bootcamp student at most any bootcamp. So if any of these tasks is difficult for you - you should know that, going in.
